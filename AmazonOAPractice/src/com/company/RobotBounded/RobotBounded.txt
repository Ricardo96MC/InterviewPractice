Roboto Bounded in Circle:

On an infinite plane, a robot initialy stands at (0,0) and faces north. It can recieve 1 of 3 instructions:
    "G": go straight 1
    "L": ROTATE left 1
    "R": ROTATE right 1

The robot completes this set of given instructions infinitely, return true if there exists a circle in the place which
the robot never leaves from

Example 1:
    Input:  instructions = "GGLLGG"
    Output: true

    Explanation:
        The robot moves from (0,0) to (0,2), turns 180 degrees, and then returns to (0,0).
        When repeating these instructions, the robot remains in the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.
